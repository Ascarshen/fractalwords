# fractalwords

Prepared for “Programming Competition” UOE Inf1A, programming with haskell

- Many thanks to OpenGL_Tutorial, which opens a door to computer graphicsmy for me.
- I am also deeply indebte to all the tutors and teachers in funtional programing and computational logic for their direct and indirect help to me.
- Thanks to my friend Litu Ou and others, whenever I walked with you side by side I saw a group of young people full of enthusiasm and vitality, which encourage me a lot.
- Special thanks to https://mathr.co.uk/blog/ which gives me the idea for fractal words, provided basic engine for graphgrow and vedio producing as well. 
- Finally, I must show my gratitude to my beloved girl Lexuan, thanks for her love, waiting and care. I owe her everthing.
- To be honse , I don't intend to submit this code. In my opinion, it still has a lot of deficiencies, and there are many things that I don't understand behind the code itself, but I believe that I will continue to figure it out in the future.

- _Hope this competion even the course Inf1A could potentially pioneer a critical thinking approach to academics, instead of signifing the ulimate of that._


- 加油期末，奥利给！
