- To be honset , I don't intend to submit this code. In my opinion, it still has a lot of deficiencies, and there are many things that I don't understand behind the code itself, but I believe that I will continue to figure it out in the future.

**Hope this competion even the course Inf1A could potentially pioneer a critical thinking approach to academics, instead of signifing the ulimate of that.**
